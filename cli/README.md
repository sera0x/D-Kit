# dkit-cli

Command-line interface for [D-Kit](https://github.com/sera0x/D-Kit). Secrets,
scaffolding, cron jobs, uptime monitors, and log shipping from one
`dkit` command.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g dkit-cli
```

No install script in this package: everything is plain JavaScript, so
`npm ci --ignore-scripts` and pnpm's default settings work fine.

Prefer not to use npm? The same CLI ships as a tarball with every GitHub
release, with an installer that verifies the checksum first:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sera0x/D-Kit/main/install.sh | sh
```

## Quickstart

```bash
dkit signup        # create an account on your D-Kit server
dkit login
dkit new my-app    # scaffold a project (express-pg, node-api, scheduled-job, static-site)
dkit env:set DATABASE_URL postgres://...
```

`dkit doctor` checks the whole setup (API reachability, session, project
link, key validity) and exits non-zero on failure, so it works as a CI gate.
Run `dkit --help` for every command.

## Configuration

The CLI talks to `http://localhost:3001` by default. Point it at your server:

```bash
export DKIT_API_URL=https://your-server
```

Project settings (which project a folder talks to, cached session) live in
`.dkit/state.json`, created by `dkit projects:link` or `dkit new`.
